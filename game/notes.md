## DUCHESSE

#### Jour 1

Counselor announces that the Duchess is coming for an audience. She wants to go to war.
Choice of answer:
1. **5 points military**
  "But the Duchess has no valid reason to go to war."
  XX pts D <== not sure if a thing or not
2. **5 pts Internal affairs/history**
  "Her duchy has been trying to find a reason to expand their border for quite some time. Her father tried."
  XX pts D
3. "Thank you. Bring her in."

Duchess introduces herself:
I'm xxxx of xxxx it's an honor etc
I've requested an audience today and travelled far from my duchy today because I am in a dire situation. I should like to get straight to the point: I need to declare war to Advena, the nothern neighbouring kingdom of Dwarves.

// 2 answers : a nice one and a wtf lady one

Duchess :"My kingdom has been attacked over 30 times those last 3 months."
  **7 points militaires** // __this is only extra info for the player and possibly boosting favorable outcome, but if check is not met then it's skipped__
  H : "Advena has a small army and has problem at their northern border. They would not want to divide their forces fighting on their South border..."
  XX pts D
H : "The army of Advena is attacking you ?"

Their people are your Grace. I cannot tolerate this any longer. They need to be shown that pillaging our ressources, terrorizing~ our people and generating chaos is not without consequences.
I came to request your assistance. I wish you would send troops to help me fight this threat.
If you choose not to however, I would simply request your permission to go to war against them and protect my people and land.

1. H : "I will consider your proposition"
2. H : "I'll summon you when I've reached a decision"

H : "You will have my answer in 2 weeks, before you leave."

#### Jour 2

Counselors - Present General and Interal affairs guy

H : "We need to analyse this situation carefully. We are talking about war here! As if I didn't have enough on my plate already !"
 **10 points militaires**
  "A war would have costly consequences that simply can't be estimated properly."

================= MILITAIRE ===================
"Cassandra, as my military advisor what is your opinion?"
Cassandra : "If we ally the force of the castle army with that of the Duchess we would win without a shadow of a doubt."
1. "What if we help the Duchess? What about the cost for the kingdom?"
    C "The kingdom's army would not lose too many troops. But the troops would not be interested in going to war with a country that we have nothing against."
2. "What if we refuse to help?"
    c "The Duchy of xxxx could win without our help."
    **MILITARY 5pts** "But with our help they would crush them and suffer little loss."
    "Still they are asking for help."
    "Could we compromise and send half of our forces?"
    **MILITARY 5pts** "If we just sent half the troops we would definitely win, but we would have significant losses."

================== INTERNAL ======================
Leo : "Going to war would have important repercussions."
  "We would have other duchies asking to do the same."
    **Internal 5pts**
      H: "The Duke of Telsna has been eyeing Dwarves ressources for a long time and would want to go against them."
      L : "Indeed, and that would mean full out war with the Dwarves."
    H : "Do you know of any Duke I should be worried about?"
    L : "Maybe the Duke of Telsna. He also happens to have a border with the Dwarves."
  L : "We will also have to face the wrath of the Dwarves Kingdom for the attack of the Duchess, which could mean severe penalties on import/export."
  "And let's not forget that it might divide the nobles more into the pacifists and the power hungry."
  H : "I can do without that."
  1. H: So if we help the Duchess we are making a big mistake ?
    L : "We would acquire ressources. The duchy is next to ressources of myrthril."
        "Needless to say that it would be VERY valuable. We could then increase her taxes, produce new goods and export them."
        "But there could be consequences as I told you."
  2. What if we tell her not to do anything?
        L : "She might still go and that would be a big problem."
        H : "She's giving me a headache."
        "If she doesn't do anything though... We might use this to our advantage."
        H : "..."
        "..."
        "Are you going to say how?"
        L : "I like to build suspense, sorry."
        "She wants to go to war, fine. We could help the Dwarves in their current war on their northern border."
        C : "We would double their forces. The victory is guaranteed."
        L : "But we need a deal with the Dwarves, a sort of alliance, the agreement of the Duchess and we need it fast before she can cause chaos on her own."

"Alright. I think I have all the information I need."
C : "What's your choice?"

================= CHOICE =================

===== TO WAR! =====

1. H :"Time to increase the riches of the castle. A swift war, little losses, big rewards."
    C : "Some exercice for our royal troops."
    L : "And lots of money coming our way."

    C : "We need to motivate our troops first."
    H : "Propaganda then."
    L : Yes, the moral of the troops is critical.
    C : For propaganda to work we need our soldiers to identify themselves with the cause. They must be certain that our cause is just. They must believe we can win. And finally there is a need for displine and unity. I will do the disciplice part.
    H : "We will say that we are coming to the rescue of the Duchess that has been *harassed incessantly* by the Dwarves."
    1. Propaganda to our soldiers.
        1. Let's demonize our enemy. A good portrayal of their evilness as oppose to our righteousness.
        C : // explanation of demonizing
        promotes an idea about the enemy being threatening evil aggressor with only destructive objectives. Demonization is the oldest propaganda technique aimed to inspire hatred toward the enemy necessary to hurt them more easily, to preserve and mobilize allies and demoralize the enemy.
        ***(base 78%) (Military bonus +2 or +5 or 0) Counselor bonus (+3 max)***

        2. Let's reinforce the feeling of unity across the kingdom. Attacking the Duchess is attacking the whole kingdom.
        C : // attacking them is attacking us bullshit <-- to develop/explain
        ***(base 74%) (Military bonus +2 or +5 or 0) Counselor bonus (+3 max)***

    L : "We also need to make sure the other Nobles understand that it's an exception."
    2. Tell the nobles that the Duchess is not attacking but defending. The nobles might have access to information though and know that she's not in any real danger.
    L :"True. But we could fabricate proof that it's something much bigger. Fake witnesses."
    // fausses lettres envoyées secrètement par conseiller de la duchesse demandant à certains nobles de l'aide parce que situation desespérée.
        1. "We have witnesses coming to testify at the court one day when all the nobles are there."
        ***(base 76%) (Military bonus +2 or +5 or 0) Counselor bonus (+3 max)***
        2. "We forge a letter send by an anonymous counselor of the Duchess asking various nobles for help in this dire, sinister, tragic situation"
        ***(base 74%) (Military bonus +2 or +5 or 0) Counselor bonus (+3 max)***

===== PEACE =====

2. "Let's try to see if we can stop her and turn this whole thing around."
    C : "I can help the Duchess' General."
    L : "We will need to be careful, I'll help."

    1. "Forcing" the Duchess to agree
        1. // forged letter from a parent living in her kingdom stating that while she was away (now basically) they've discovered that the Dwarves had advanced weaponery that could swing the tie of battle.
        ***(base 74%) (Military bonus +2 or +5 or 0) Counselor bonus (+3 max)***
        2. // A fake spy (paid and corrupted) tell the ruler during an assembly with the nobles that the Dwarves are making an alliance with whatever other country (therefore more than doubling the size of their army)
        ***(base 71%) (Military bonus +2 or +5 or 0) Counselor bonus (+3 max)***

    2. MAking sure the Dwarves agree to a deal with the Duchess about her coming with her army to help on the northern border and getting in exchange a piece of their land with some myrthril to exploit
        1. Whataboutism // explanation of what it is
        ***(base 68%) (Military bonus +2 or +5 or 0) Counselor bonus (+3 max)***
        2. Confuse them by saying that this whole idea of the Duchess preparing to invade was fake news from the guys they are at war with so that the troops would be divided on two fronts and to demoralize the troops. // explain how demoralizing troops is critical etc
        ***(base 73%) (Military bonus +2 or +5 or 0) Counselor bonus (+3 max)***

// Once a choice is made life goes on.
After two weeks, result is given : success or failure of the mission. Different dialogs then with the Duchess. Chapter is concluded.
